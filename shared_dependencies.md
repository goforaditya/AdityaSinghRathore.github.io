Shared Dependencies:

1. Next.js: This is the main framework used for building the application. It is used in all the files for server-side rendering and routing.

2. TypeScript: This is used for type checking and improved developer experience. It is used in all the .tsx files.

3. React: This is implicitly used in all the .tsx files as Next.js is built on top of React.

4. Mailchimp: This is used in the "mailchimp.ts" files for receiving emails.

5. CSS Modules: These are used in all the .css files for styling the components.

6. Shared Components: The "Header.tsx" and "Footer.tsx" components are likely used in multiple pages of the application.

7. Shared Styles: The "globals.css" file is likely imported in multiple files to apply global styles.

8. Shared Utilities: The "utils/mailchimp.ts" file is likely imported in the "api/mailchimp.ts" file and possibly others to handle Mailchimp related functionality.

9. Shared DOM Elements: The id names of DOM elements used in the JavaScript functions are shared across the .tsx files.

10. Shared Functions: Functions defined in one file may be imported and used in another file. For example, functions defined in "utils/mailchimp.ts" may be used in "api/mailchimp.ts".

11. Shared Data Schemas: If there are any data schemas defined, they would be shared across the .tsx and .ts files.

12. Shared Message Names: If the application uses any messaging system (like events or pub/sub), the message names would be shared across the .tsx and .ts files.

13. Package.json: This file contains the list of dependencies and scripts that are shared across the entire application.

14. tsconfig.json: This file contains the TypeScript configuration that is shared across all TypeScript files in the application.
